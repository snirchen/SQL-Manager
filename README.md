## Key Features 🌟
* Thread Safety: Ensures that SQL queries are handled safely in multi-threaded environments, avoiding potential conflicts and data corruption.
* SQL Injection Prevention: Utilizes parameterized queries and other best practices to protect against SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Enhanced Security: Implements secure coding techniques to safeguard your database interactions.
* Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with various SQL databases, providing a straightforward interface for executing queries.

## Why Use This Framework? 💡
* Security First: Safeguard your database from malicious attacks with built-in protection against SQL injection.
* Concurrent Access: Maintain data integrity and performance even with high levels of concurrent database access.
* Simplified Code: Write cleaner and more maintainable database code with thread-safe functions.

## Getting Started 🛠️
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Wrap your SQL queries with provided functions to ensure security and thread safety (see examples section).

## Examples 🔍
```python
    sql_manager.create_table(table_name="clients",
                             fields={
                                 'ID': 'text NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY',
                                 'Name': 'varchar(255)'
                             },
                             throw_if_exists=False)
```
